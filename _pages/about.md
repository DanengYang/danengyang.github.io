Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a researcher actively working on the fascinating realm of dark matter physics, covering astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics. My primary focus is on probing new physics by studying astrophysical signatures and gaining a deeper understanding of the distribution of cosmic dark matter. While the existence of dark matter is firmly established through gravitational interaction, its properties, such as possible self-interactions and interactions with standard model particles, remain elusive. The hierarchical distribution of dark matter, arising from its complex non-linear evolution under gravity, adds another layer of complexity to the search for new physics effects. Excitingly, the realm of dark matter physics is witnessing groundbreaking advancements through existing and upcoming observations. Remarkable achievements, such as the stochastic gravitational wave, the merger of binary black holes, and massive galaxies at high redshifts, have enriched our understanding of the universe and brought us closer to unraveling the mystery features of dark matter. Beyond my work in dark matter physics, I have also dedicated efforts to searching for multi-gauge boson productions and interactions in collider experiments. Please feel free to explore my page to learn more about my research! If you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to reach out.

Probing new physics through astrophysical observations 
------
We are in an era of using multimessenger astrophysical observations to explore fundamental physics. With collaborators, I have explored a number of new physics scenarios, including self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), freeze-in dark matter, and axion dark matter. However, my primary focus has been SIDM, and I have performed substantial studies. With Prof. Hai-Bo Yu, and Prof. Haipeng An (THU), we demonstrated in a PRL paper (Editor's suggestion) that SIDM could enhance the tidal stripping of core-forming halos, which can facilitate the formation of galaxies that lack dark matter. With Prof. Yu, we examined strong lensing features in light of an observational excess of small-scale lenses and highlighted the differences between SIDM and cold dark matter (CDM) scenarios. Recently, I collaborated with Dr. Nadler and Prof. Yu to perform high-resolution cosmological simulations and demonstrated promising features of some strong velocity-dependent SIDM models in reproducing observational features. I continue to employ a combination of high-precision N-body simulations and analytic/semi-analytic models to uncover clues of SIDM in observations.

Parametric and graph models
------
I put my efforts into searching for simple rules under complex data. In works with collaborators, I conducted N-body simulations to investigate the reason a fluid model can be used to describe the evolution of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. I proposed a reduction formula for a generic elastic scattering cross section to quantify its effect in a specific halo. Using this reduction formula and the universal behavior of gravothermal evolution, I further proposed a parametric model to model a population of cosmic SIDM halos based on a few analytic equations. In another recent work, I uncovered some hidden topological features in the distribution of dark matter halos and encoded them using networks. I proposed a simple random graph model to generate these properties. This study provides a new angle of looking at the clustering of dark matter and is related to recent applications of graph neural networks in probing features of dark matter halos.

Gauge boson searches
------
In a different direction, I worked with Prof. Qiang Li (PKU), Prof. Yajun Mao (PKU), and other collaborators on multiple collider experiments and phenomenology projects about multi-gauge-boson production and gauge boson self-interactions. I led the first measurement of W-gamma vector boson scattering analysis in the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and actively participated in the first triboson production analysis at the LHC. I also contributed to several other experimental and phenomenological studies with published papers.
